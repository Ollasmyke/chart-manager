## Installing a React application
- Install Node from nodejs.org, if MacOS, use brew.sh
- When you install Node, NPM comes with it.
- You can choose an alternative for NPM, which is Yarn.
    - Install Yarn using npm `npm i -g yarn`
- Install React app, `npx create-react-app name-of-the-app`
- npx also comes with Node (versions npm 5+ which is also Node 8+)
- npx, which is Node Package Execute, helps to exceute CLIs and libraries from node, without installing it.

## Available Scripts when using React
In the ReactJS project directory, you can run:
### `yarn start` or `npm start`
In order to serve/run the application
You will also see any lint errors in the console/terminal.

### `yarn test` or `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
